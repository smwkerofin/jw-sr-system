Web Of Intrigue - RuneQuest MODS 1
==================================

Strike Ranks
------------

Rather than using immutable strike Ranks this MOD aims to alter the
flow of Combat, round to round, whilst not overcomplicating
book-keeping. It is based on a ‘drawing tokens out of bag’ idea.

* Both characters and foes place a number of marked tokens in a bag. 
* The number of tokens are based on DEX (along with other modifications)
* Tokens are drawn from the bag in order, with each combatant either taking their turn to act or banking their token for later. 
* Actions include attack, cast a spell, reload, move etc
* When each combatant has drawn at least one token, the turn ends, even if tokens remains unplayed within the bag.
* Strike Rank (in its original sense) are used only on first contact between combatants. One  a token from either combatant is drawn compare Strike Ranks. The lowest strike ranks attacks first (even if this combatant did not draw the token) followed straight after a counter-attack from the opponent.
* Actions can be banked for future, either delaying until the end of the round or added to a second token for a different affect.
